graphs-dict
===========

Python implementation of graph data structures and algorithms is presented. 
The minimal graph interface is defined together with several 
classes implementing this interface. 
Graph nodes can be any hashable Python objects. 
Directed edges are instances of the Edge class. 
Graphs are instances of the Graph class (several versions).
Multigraphs are instances of the MultiGraph class.
Many algorithms are implemented using a unified approach. 
There are separate classes and modules devoted to different algorithms.
